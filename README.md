Sitecore-Publish-Exclusions
=======================

This Sitecore module allows you to configure publish exclusions (not publish restrictions) for any content item and its descendants in your Sitecore instance. Publish exclusions can be configured separately for each publishing target and for each publish mode. The module also works with Sitecore's new Publishing Service, though it requires additional steps to be followed.

More details about this module is available on my blog [post](https://thesitecorezone.wordpress.com/2015/10/31/sitecore-publish-exclusions/). For installing, configuring and using the module, refer to the post [here](https://thesitecorezone.wordpress.com/2016/11/03/sitecore-publish-exclusions-module/).
